Example Equations & Frequency Anchors
	1.	Faraday/EM Shielding:
￼
where ￼ is attenuation in dB, ￼ is thickness, and ￼ is skin depth.
	2.	Acoustic Damping:
￼
(simplified mass law formula; ￼ is surface mass density, ￼, ￼ is characteristic impedance).
	3.	Binaural Beat Psychoacoustics:
\[
\Delta f = |f_L - f_R| \quad \text{(usually } 1 \text{–} 30 Hz range)},
\]
with psychoacoustic correlation to EEG frequencies:
￼
	4.	Spin Wave Disruption (advanced and speculative):
￼
where ￼ is the gyromagnetic ratio, ￼ is permeability of free space, and ￼ is the effective magnetic field. Adjust your magnets/fields to push the system away from resonant states.
