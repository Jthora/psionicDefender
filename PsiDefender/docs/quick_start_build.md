# Quick Start Build Guide 🚀

This guide walks you through building a **basic Psi Defender** using commonly available materials. The design is modular, allowing you to start with a simple passive shield and add advanced features later.

## Overview 🛠️

The Psi Defender uses **layered shielding**, **magnetic field disruption**, and optional **active countermeasures** to protect against sonic, electromagnetic, and psionic threats.

This guide covers:

1. Building a **basic shield** (conductive + acoustic layers).  
2. Adding **magnetic field disruption** with neodymium magnets.  
3. (Optional) Preparing for **active countermeasures**.

## Materials Checklist 📝

### Required Materials
- **Helmet base**: Lightweight helmet or bike helmet.
- **Copper foil tape** (1 roll).
- **Aluminum foil** (kitchen-grade).
- **Acoustic foam** or **mass-loaded vinyl**.
- **Neodymium magnets** (6–8 small discs or bars).
- **Adhesives**: Hot glue or epoxy.

### Tools
- Scissors or utility knife.
- Multimeter (optional, for testing continuity).
- Hot glue gun.

### Optional Materials
- **Mu-metal strips** for enhanced magnetic shielding.
- **LED strips** for aesthetics.

## Step 1: Prepare the Helmet Base 🪖

1. **Select Your Helmet**  
   - Use a lightweight helmet, such as a bike or hardhat.  
   - Ensure it fits snugly with space for internal padding and layers.

2. **Clean the Surface**  
   - Wipe down the helmet’s interior and exterior with a clean cloth to ensure adhesives bond properly.

## Step 2: Add the Conductive Shielding 🛡️

1. **Apply Copper Foil Tape**  
   - Line the **interior** of the helmet with copper foil tape.  
   - Overlap the edges slightly to ensure continuity.  

2. **Test Continuity (Optional)**  
   - Use a multimeter to confirm the entire shield is electrically connected.  

3. **Add Aluminum Foil (Optional)**  
   - For additional shielding, layer aluminum foil over the copper tape. Use tape to secure the edges.

## Step 3: Install Acoustic Dampening 🔇

1. **Cut Foam or Vinyl**  
   - Trim acoustic foam or mass-loaded vinyl to fit the helmet interior.  

2. **Attach the Dampening Layer**  
   - Use hot glue to secure the foam or vinyl over the conductive layer.  
   - Focus on the **sides** (near the ears) and **crown** for maximum sound absorption.

## Step 4: Add Magnetic Field Disruption 🧲

1. **Place Neodymium Magnets**  
   - Arrange magnets in a **ring** around the rim of the helmet.  
   - Use a **repelling configuration** (magnets pushing against each other) to create a tension zone.

2. **Secure the Magnets**  
   - Use epoxy glue or hot glue to keep the magnets firmly in place.  
   - Test the magnetic field using a magnet viewer or simple iron filings.

## Step 5: Test Your Basic Shield ⚡

1. **Electromagnetic Test**  
   - Place a smartphone inside the helmet and check signal attenuation (e.g., reduced WiFi or cellular strength).

2. **Acoustic Test**  
   - Play loud sounds or low-frequency tones near the helmet and check for reduced sound penetration.

---

## Optional: Prepare for Active Countermeasures ⚡

1. **Install Microcontroller Mounts**  
   - Attach a small platform (e.g., Velcro or brackets) for a microcontroller (e.g., Arduino Nano).

2. **Plan for Coil Placement**  
   - Mark locations for coil windings or piezo sensors if you plan to add active jamming or noise cancellation later.

---

## Step 6: Customize and Finalize 🎨

1. **Comfort Adjustments**  
   - Add padding or adjust foam layers for a comfortable fit.

2. **Aesthetic Design**  
   - Decorate with LED strips, stickers, or paint to blend into a rave or casual environment.
