## 10. Notes and Recommendations ‚úçÔ∏è
- **Reuse materials**: If you already have magnets, foil, or a helmet, this can significantly reduce costs.
- **Local availability**: Check hardware stores, Amazon, and eBay for commonly available items.
- **Advanced experiments**: Optional items like ferrofluid or graphene ink are not essential for basic builds.
