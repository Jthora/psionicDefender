## 1. General Safety Precautions üõ°Ô∏è

1. **Wear Protective Gear**  
   - Use **safety goggles** when soldering, cutting, or working with adhesives.  
   - Wear gloves when handling sharp tools or strong adhesives.

2. **Ensure Proper Ventilation**  
   - Work in a well-ventilated area when using adhesives, spray paints, or other chemicals.  

3. **Keep Your Workspace Organized**  
   - Maintain a clutter-free workspace to reduce the risk of accidents.  
   - Store sharp tools and hazardous materials safely when not in use.

## 2. Electrical Safety ‚ö°

1. **Avoid Short Circuits**  
   - Double-check all connections and ensure no exposed wires can contact each other.  
   - Use **heat shrink tubing** or electrical tape to insulate exposed wires.

2. **Handle Batteries Safely**  
   - Only use battery packs with built-in **protection circuits** to avoid overcharging or overheating.  
   - Do not puncture, crush, or overheat batteries. Dispose of damaged batteries properly.

3. **Power Off Before Working**  
   - Always disconnect the battery or power source before making adjustments to the circuit.  

4. **Limit Power Output**  
   - Ensure active modules (e.g., jamming devices) comply with local laws regarding electromagnetic emissions. Excessive power can be dangerous.

## 3. Magnetic Safety üß≤

1. **Handle Neodymium Magnets Carefully**  
   - Neodymium magnets are very strong and can snap together unexpectedly, causing injuries.  
   - Keep magnets away from electronics, credit cards, and pacemakers.  

2. **Secure Magnets Properly**  
   - Use strong adhesives (e.g., epoxy) to prevent magnets from shifting or detaching during use.

3. **Store Magnets Safely**  
   - Store magnets with spacers to reduce the risk of accidental snapping or pinching.

## 4. Acoustic Safety üîá

1. **Limit Exposure to Loud Sounds**  
   - Avoid prolonged exposure to high-decibel test tones or ultrasonic signals during experiments.  
   - Wear **ear protection** when testing active sound modules.

2. **Monitor Infrasound Effects**  
   - Be cautious when working with infrasound (below 20 Hz), as it can cause discomfort or disorientation in humans.  

3. **Test in Controlled Environments**  
   - Conduct sound tests in isolated or soundproofed areas to avoid disturbing others.

## 5. Mechanical Safety ü™ñ

1. **Avoid Sharp Edges**  
   - Smooth any sharp edges on metal parts or 3D-printed components to prevent cuts.  

2. **Secure Components Properly**  
   - Ensure all parts are securely attached to the helmet to avoid movement or detachment during use.  

3. **Test Fit Before Use**  
   - Check that the helmet fits snugly and comfortably before using it in a real-world scenario.

## 6. Chemical Safety üß™

1. **Use Adhesives Safely**  
   - Follow manufacturer instructions when using hot glue, epoxy, or spray adhesives.  
   - Avoid direct skin contact with adhesives; use gloves as needed.

2. **Handle Exotic Materials Cautiously**  
   - If using ferrofluid, graphene ink, or other experimental materials, handle them with care.  
   - Follow Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) guidelines for storage and disposal.

3. **Clean Up Spills Immediately**  
   - If you spill chemicals, clean them promptly to avoid slipping or exposure.

## 7. Legal and Ethical Considerations ‚öñÔ∏è

1. **Comply with Local Laws**  
   - Be aware of and adhere to regulations regarding electromagnetic emissions, jamming devices, and power levels.  
   - Do not operate active modules in public without confirming legality.

2. **Respect Privacy**  
   - Use the Psi Defender responsibly for defensive purposes only. Do not use it to harass or interfere with others.  

3. **Avoid Public Panic**  
   - If wearing the Psi Defender in public, ensure it does not appear threatening or suspicious.

## 8. Emergency Procedures üö®

1. **Electrical Fire**  
   - Disconnect power immediately and use a **CO2 or dry chemical fire extinguisher**.  
   - Do not use water on electrical fires.

2. **Magnet-Related Injuries**  
   - Seek medical attention if magnets cause severe pinching, cuts, or injuries.  

3. **Chemical Exposure**  
   - Rinse affected areas with water immediately and contact poison control if necessary.  

4. **Hearing Discomfort**  
   - Stop using active modules immediately if you or others experience discomfort, dizziness, or hearing loss.

---

## 9. Maintenance and Inspection üîç

1. **Inspect Regularly**  
   - Check for loose connections, damaged wires, or worn components before each use.  

2. **Replace Worn Parts**  
   - Replace magnets, batteries, or adhesives that show signs of wear or degradation.  

3. **Store Safely**  
   - Store the Psi Defender in a dry, cool location to prevent damage to electronics and materials.
