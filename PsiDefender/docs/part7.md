## 1. Electromagnetic Shielding üõ°Ô∏è

To estimate the effectiveness of conductive shielding materials, we use the **skin depth** $\\delta$, which determines how deep electromagnetic waves penetrate into a conductor:

$$
\\delta = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\rho}{\\omega \\mu}}
$$

Where:
- $\\rho$ is the material's resistivity (e.g., copper: $1.68 \\times 10^{-8}$ ohm-meters),
- $\\omega = 2 \\pi f$ is the angular frequency,
- $\\mu$ is the material's permeability.

**Shielding Effectiveness (SE)** in decibels (dB) can be calculated as:

$$
SE = 20 \\log_{10}(e) \\cdot \\frac{t}{\\delta}
$$

Where:
- $t$ is the thickness of the shielding material,
- $\\delta$ is the skin depth.

### Application:
For a copper foil layer with $t = 0.05$ mm at a frequency $f = 2.45$ GHz (microwave resonant frequency of water), calculate $SE$ to evaluate the attenuation.

## 2. Acoustic Dampening üîá

The Psi Defender uses materials like **mass-loaded vinyl (MLV)** and **acoustic foam** to block or absorb sound. The effectiveness of acoustic barriers can be modeled using the **transmission loss** formula:

$$
TL = 20 \\log_{10} \\left(\\frac{m \\cdot f}{\\rho c} \\right)
$$

Where:
- $m$ is the surface density of the barrier (kg/m¬≤),
- $f$ is the frequency (Hz),
- $\\rho$ is the air density (1.2 kg/m¬≥),
- $c$ is the speed of sound in air (343 m/s).

### Application:
For an MLV layer with $m = 5$ kg/m¬≤, calculate the transmission loss at infrasonic frequencies ($f = 20$ Hz) and ultrasonic frequencies ($f = 20,000$ Hz).

## 3. Magnetic Field Disruption üß≤

The use of **mu-metal** and **neodymium magnets** helps disrupt low-frequency magnetic fields. The magnetic shielding factor (S) is given by:

$$
S = \\frac{\\mu_r t}{d}
$$

Where:
- $\\mu_r$ is the relative permeability of the material,
- $t$ is the thickness of the shielding material,
- $d$ is the distance from the field source.

### Application:
For a mu-metal layer with $\\mu_r = 100,000$ and $t = 0.1$ mm, calculate the shielding factor at varying distances from the field source.

## 4. Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) ‚ö°

To generate counter-phase signals for **acoustic noise cancellation**, the Psi Defender relies on **piezoelectric sensors** and **microcontrollers**. The cancellation waveform is calculated as:

$$
s_c(t) = -s_i(t)
$$

Where:
- $s_i(t)$ is the incoming sound wave,
- $s_c(t)$ is the counter-phase wave.

### Binaural Beats and Brainwave Entrainment:
The Psi Defender may use **binaural beats** to stabilize the wearer's brainwaves. The beat frequency is calculated as:

$$
f_b = |f_l - f_r|
$$

Where:
- $f_l$ and $f_r$ are the frequencies of tones played in the left and right ears, respectively.

### Application:
To induce an alpha brainwave state (8‚Äì12 Hz), set $f_l = 440$ Hz and calculate $f_r$.

## 5. Frequency Anchors üîë

### Key Frequencies for Shielding and Defense:
- **Microwave Resonant Frequency of Water:** $2.45$ GHz (targeted in microwave attacks).
- **Alpha Brainwaves:** $8‚Äì12$ Hz (associated with relaxation and mental clarity).
- **Theta Brainwaves:** $4‚Äì8$ Hz (associated with deep meditation).
- **Infrasound:** Below $20$ Hz (can cause discomfort or anxiety).
- **Ultrasound:** Above $20,000$ Hz (used in high-frequency attacks).

### Resonant Frequencies of the Chakras:
The Psi Defender aligns certain defense mechanisms with chakra-related frequencies:
- **396 Hz**: Root Chakra
- **417 Hz**: Sacral Chakra
- **528 Hz**: Solar Plexus Chakra
- **639 Hz**: Heart Chakra
- **741 Hz**: Throat Chakra
- **852 Hz**: Third Eye Chakra
- **963 Hz**: Crown Chakra

### Application:
Incorporate these frequencies into **active jamming signals** or **resonance-based countermeasures**.
