# Coil Winding Instructions üåÄ

This document provides step-by-step instructions for creating electromagnetic coils used in the **Psi Defender**. Coils play a critical role in active jamming, RF signal disruption, and enhancing magnetic shielding.

## 1. Objectives üéØ

1. Create electromagnetic coils with precise specifications for active countermeasures.
2. Ensure consistent and repeatable winding for optimal performance.
3. Minimize electrical resistance and maintain structural integrity.

---

## 2. Materials & Tools üõ†Ô∏è

### Required Materials
- **Copper wire**: 22‚Äì28 AWG enamel-coated wire.
- **Spool**: Empty spool or cylindrical core (e.g., PVC pipe, 3D-printed core).
- **Insulation tape**: For securing the wire layers.
- **Heat shrink tubing**: For insulating wire ends.
- **Adhesive (optional)**: Hot glue or epoxy for stabilizing the coil.

### Required Tools
- **Wire strippers**: To remove insulation from wire ends.
- **Multimeter**: To test continuity and measure resistance.
- **Drill with a spool attachment (optional)**: For faster winding.
- **Soldering iron**: To attach the coil ends to terminals or connectors.

## 3. Coil Design Specifications ‚öôÔ∏è

### Parameters to Define
1. **Number of turns (N):** Total loops of wire.
2. **Wire gauge (AWG):** Determines resistance and current capacity.
3. **Coil diameter (D):** Diameter of the core around which the wire is wound.
4. **Inductance (L):** Target inductance value in microhenries ($\mu H$).

### Example:
- **Core Diameter (D):** 5 cm
- **Wire Gauge:** 26 AWG
- **Turns (N):** 200
- **Target Inductance (L):** 100 $\mu H$

Use the following formula to estimate inductance:
$$
L = \\frac{N^2 \\cdot \\mu \\cdot A}{l}
$$
Where:
- $N$ = Number of turns
- $\\mu$ = Permeability of core material
- $A$ = Cross-sectional area of the coil
- $l$ = Length of the coil

## 4. Step-by-Step Instructions üß™

### Step 1: Prepare the Core
1. Select a suitable core material:
   - **Air core** for minimal interference.
   - **Ferrite core** for enhanced inductance.
2. Cut the core to the desired length (e.g., 10 cm for a compact coil).

---

### Step 2: Start the Winding
1. Secure one end of the copper wire to the core or spool using tape or adhesive.
2. Begin winding the wire **tightly and evenly** around the core:
   - Maintain consistent tension to avoid loose loops.
   - Ensure each turn is placed closely without overlapping.

---

### Step 3: Layer the Coil
1. Once the first layer is complete, secure it with insulation tape.
2. Begin winding the second layer directly on top of the first, in the **same direction**.
3. Repeat until the desired number of turns is reached.

---

### Step 4: Secure the Coil
1. Use insulation tape or adhesive to secure the final layer of the coil.
2. Strip the insulation from the wire ends (approximately 1 cm) using wire strippers.
3. (Optional) Apply heat shrink tubing to the ends for additional insulation.

---

### Step 5: Test the Coil
1. Use a multimeter to check the continuity of the coil:
   - Place probes on each end of the wire.
   - Ensure the resistance is within the expected range for your wire gauge and length.
2. Calculate the inductance using an LCR meter if available.

---

## 5. Mounting the Coil ‚ö°

1. Place the completed coil in its designated position on the Psi Defender:
   - Example: Side-mounted for field disruption.
2. Secure the coil with adhesive, brackets, or zip ties.
3. Connect the coil to the circuit:
   - Use a soldering iron to attach the wire ends to terminals or connectors.
   - Ensure proper polarity if required.

---

## 6. Safety Precautions ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Avoid Overheating**: Do not overheat the wire when soldering to prevent damage to the enamel coating.
2. **Check Insulation**: Ensure no exposed wire is in contact with conductive surfaces to avoid short circuits.
3. **Use Proper Tools**: Handle sharp tools (e.g., wire strippers, scissors) carefully.

## 7. Troubleshooting üîß

| Issue                  | Possible Cause                     | Solution                                |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| No continuity          | Broken or loose wire               | Rewind the coil or check connections.  |
| High resistance        | Excessive wire length              | Use thicker wire (lower AWG).          |
| Low inductance         | Insufficient turns or wrong core   | Increase turns or use a ferrite core.  |

## 8. Advanced Techniques üöÄ

1. **Multi-Layer Coils**  
   - For higher inductance, increase the number of layers, ensuring even winding across all layers.

2. **Helical Coils**  
   - Wind the coil at an angle for specialized electromagnetic fields (e.g., directional jamming).

3. **Cooling Systems**  
   - For high-power applications, integrate cooling mechanisms such as airflow channels or heat sinks.
