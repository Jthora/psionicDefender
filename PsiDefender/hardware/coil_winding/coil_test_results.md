## 4. Observations and Analysis 📈

1. **Performance Notes:**  
   *E.g., The measured inductance was slightly below the target, likely due to insufficient turns.*

2. **Frequency Response:**  
   *E.g., The coil demonstrated strong performance at 2.4 GHz but less effectiveness at lower frequencies.*

3. **Physical Issues:**  
   *E.g., One layer of the coil showed overlapping turns, causing uneven field distribution.*
