# Magnet Placement Plan üß≤

This document outlines the recommended layout and configuration for placing magnets in the helmet base of the Psi Defender. Proper placement ensures optimal magnetic field disruption and enhances the effectiveness of the device.

---

## 1. Objectives üéØ

1. Create a magnetic array to disrupt low-frequency magnetic fields.
2. Ensure even distribution to prevent gaps in magnetic protection.
3. Avoid interference with electronic components or sensors.

## 2. Materials & Tools üõ†Ô∏è

### Materials
- **Neodymium magnets** (Grade N52 recommended)
  - Quantity: 6‚Äì10 magnets (depending on helmet size).
  - Shape: Discs or small bars.
- **Adhesive**: Epoxy glue or strong double-sided tape for securing magnets.
- **Non-magnetic spacer** (optional): Thin plastic or rubber to stabilize magnet placement.

### Tools
- **Ruler or measuring tape**: For accurate spacing.
- **Marker**: To outline placement points on the helmet.
- **Magnet viewer** (optional): To visualize the magnetic field distribution.

## 3. Placement Configuration üìê

### Recommended Patterns
1. **Ring Configuration** (default):  
   - Arrange magnets in a circular pattern around the **rim** of the helmet.
   - Spacing: Place magnets approximately **5‚Äì7 cm apart**, ensuring even coverage.

2. **Checkerboard Configuration** (optional):  
   - Create a grid-like layout across the **crown** of the helmet.
   - Use alternating polarities to form a repelling field.

3. **Focused Zones** (advanced):  
   - Concentrate magnets near **temples** or **ears** to protect sensitive brain areas.

## 4. Steps for Placement üß©

1. **Mark Placement Points**  
   - Use a marker to outline where each magnet will be placed.
   - Ensure symmetry for balanced weight distribution.

2. **Check Polarities**  
   - Use a magnet viewer or other magnets to determine the polarity of each magnet.
   - Alternate poles (e.g., N-S-N-S) to maximize field disruption.

3. **Secure Magnets**  
   - Apply a small amount of epoxy glue to the base of each magnet.
   - Press the magnet firmly into place and hold for 10‚Äì20 seconds.
   - Allow the adhesive to cure fully according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.

4. **Test the Array**  
   - Use a small piece of ferrous metal (e.g., a paperclip) to confirm consistent magnetic coverage.
