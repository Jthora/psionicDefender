# Acoustic Tests: Overview 🔇

This directory contains resources and documentation for conducting acoustic tests on the **Psi Defender**. These tests evaluate the effectiveness of materials, configurations, and active modules in dampening, blocking, or canceling sound across a range of frequencies.

---

## 1. Objectives 🎯

1. **Measure Sound Dampening**  
   - Test the ability of materials (e.g., foam, mass-loaded vinyl) to reduce sound transmission.

2. **Evaluate Frequency Response**  
   - Analyze the performance of the Psi Defender across infrasound, audible, and ultrasonic frequencies.

3. **Validate Active Noise Cancellation (ANC)**  
   - Assess the efficiency of active countermeasures in mitigating targeted sound frequencies.

## 3. Required Equipment ⚙️

- **Sound Source**: Speaker or tone generator capable of producing a wide frequency range (10 Hz to 30 kHz).  
- **Decibel Meter**: Device or app to measure sound intensity.  
- **Test Materials**: Acoustic foam, mass-loaded vinyl (MLV), and other sound-blocking materials.  
- **Test Enclosure**: A small, controlled environment for consistent measurements.  

### Optional:
- **Piezoelectric Sensors**: For active noise cancellation tests.  
- **Software Tools**: Audacity, MATLAB, or similar for spectrum analysis.

## 4. Key Metrics 📊

The following metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the Psi Defender during acoustic tests:

1. **Sound Transmission Loss (STL):**  
   - Measures the reduction in sound intensity (in decibels) after passing through a material or configuration.

2. **Frequency Response:**  
   - Evaluates the effectiveness of materials or systems at specific frequencies (e.g., 20 Hz, 1 kHz, 20 kHz).

3. **Active Noise Cancellation (ANC) Efficiency:**  
   - Compares the sound levels with and without ANC enabled.

## 5. Test Scenarios 🧪

### 5.1 Passive Tests
- Measure the effectiveness of individual materials in blocking or absorbing sound.  
- Test combinations of materials for enhanced performance.

### 5.2 Active Tests
- Evaluate the performance of the active noise cancellation system in reducing specific frequency bands.  
- Assess the impact of ANC on user comfort and system stability.

## 6. Expected Outcomes 📈

1. **Material Effectiveness**  
   - Identify which materials and configurations provide the highest sound attenuation across various frequencies.

2. **ANC Performance**  
   - Validate the capability of the active noise cancellation module to mitigate targeted noise effectively.

3. **Improvement Opportunities**  
   - Gather data to refine the Psi Defender's design and optimize acoustic defense layers.
