## 3. Test Procedure üß™

### 3.1 Baseline Measurement
1. **Setup Signal Generator and Receiver**  
   - Place the RF signal generator at a fixed position in an open environment.  
   - Set the generator to emit a known frequency (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz).  

2. **Record Baseline Signal**  
   - Use the RF receiver to measure the signal strength at a fixed distance.  
   - Record the signal strength in decibels (dBm).

3. **Repeat for Multiple Frequencies**  
   - Test across a range of frequencies (e.g., 1 GHz, 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, 10 GHz).

### 3.2 Shielding Effectiveness Test
1. **Apply Test Material**  
   - Place the shielding material (e.g., copper foil, aluminum foil) between the signal generator and receiver.

2. **Measure Attenuation**  
   - Record the signal strength at the same distance as the baseline test.

3. **Calculate Shielding Effectiveness (SE)**  
   - Use the following formula:  
     $$
     SE = S_{\text{baseline}} - S_{\text{shielded}}
     $$
     Where:
     - $S_{\text{baseline}}$ = Signal strength without shielding (dBm)
     - $S_{\text{shielded}}$ = Signal strength with shielding (dBm)

4. **Repeat for Multiple Materials**  
   - Test copper foil, aluminum foil, mu-metal, and other materials.

5. **Repeat for Layered Configurations**  
   - Combine materials (e.g., copper + steel mesh) and measure their combined effectiveness.

### 3.3 Helmet Configuration Test
1. **Assemble Shielded Helmet**  
   - Incorporate the conductive materials into the helmet design.  

2. **Measure Signal Inside Helmet**  
   - Place the RF receiver inside the helmet and measure the signal strength.

3. **Compare with External Readings**  
   - Compare the internal signal strength to the external signal strength to evaluate shielding effectiveness.

## 4. Data Recording üìä

### Data Points
- **Frequency (GHz)**: The frequency of the RF signal.
- **Baseline Signal (dBm)**: Signal strength without shielding.
- **Shielded Signal (dBm)**: Signal strength with shielding applied.
- **Shielding Effectiveness (dB)**: Difference between baseline and shielded signal.

### Example Table
| Frequency (GHz) | Baseline Signal (dBm) | Shielded Signal (dBm) | Shielding Effectiveness (dB) |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| 2.4              | -20                   | -40                   | 20                           |
| 5.0              | -25                   | -50                   | 25                           |
| 10.0             | -30                   | -55                   | 25                           |

## 5. Analysis & Interpretation üìà

1. **Material Comparison**  
   - Identify which materials provide the highest SE across different frequencies.

2. **Frequency Trends**  
   - Determine if the shielding effectiveness varies significantly with frequency.

3. **Layered vs. Single Material**  
   - Assess whether layered configurations outperform single materials.

## 6. Safety Precautions ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Avoid Excessive RF Exposure**  
   - Limit exposure to high-power RF signals during testing.  
   - Ensure the signal generator operates at safe power levels.

2. **Protect Sensitive Equipment**  
   - Avoid exposing the receiver or signal generator to strong magnetic fields or physical impacts.
