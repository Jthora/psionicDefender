# RF Shielding Tests: Overview üì°

This directory contains resources and documentation for conducting RF (radio frequency) shielding tests for the **Psi Defender**. These tests are designed to evaluate the effectiveness of materials and configurations in attenuating or blocking electromagnetic waves across various frequencies.

## 1. Objectives üéØ

1. **Measure Shielding Effectiveness (SE):**  
   - Quantify the reduction in RF signal strength due to shielding materials.

2. **Evaluate Frequency Response:**  
   - Identify how shielding effectiveness varies across different frequency ranges (e.g., 1 GHz to 10 GHz).

3. **Optimize Material and Design:**  
   - Compare the performance of different materials and configurations to enhance shielding capabilities.

## 3. Required Equipment ‚öôÔ∏è

- **RF Signal Generator**: Device capable of emitting RF signals at various frequencies.  
- **RF Receiver or Spectrum Analyzer**: Tool to measure signal strength before and after shielding.  
- **Test Materials**: Copper foil, aluminum foil, mu-metal sheets, and other conductive materials.  
- **Test Enclosure (Optional)**: Shielded box or chamber to reduce external interference.  

### Optional:
- **Gauss Meter**: To measure magnetic field intensity.  
- **Software Tools**: SDR software (e.g., SDRSharp, GQRX) or spectrum analysis software.

## 4. Key Metrics üìä

The following metrics are used to evaluate RF shielding performance:

1. **Shielding Effectiveness (SE):**  
   - The difference in signal strength (in decibels) before and after applying the shield.  
   - Formula:  
     $$
     SE = S_{\text{baseline}} - S_{\text{shielded}}
     $$
     Where:  
     - $S_{\text{baseline}}$: Signal strength without shielding.  
     - $S_{\text{shielded}}$: Signal strength with shielding.

2. **Frequency Response:**  
   - The variation in shielding effectiveness across different frequencies (e.g., 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz).

3. **Material Efficiency:**  
   - Relative performance of each material tested in blocking RF signals.

## 5. Test Scenarios üß™

### 5.1 Passive Shielding Tests
- Measure the attenuation provided by individual materials (e.g., copper foil, aluminum mesh).  
- Test combinations of materials to determine optimal configurations.

### 5.2 Integrated System Tests
- Test the RF shielding effectiveness of a fully assembled Psi Defender.  
- Evaluate performance under real-world conditions (e.g., in proximity to RF sources like routers or cell towers).

## 6. Expected Outcomes üìà

1. **Material Performance**  
   - Identify materials and configurations with the highest shielding effectiveness.

2. **Frequency Insights**  
   - Determine which frequency ranges are most effectively shielded and identify any gaps.

3. **Optimization Opportunities**  
   - Use test data to refine material selection and Psi Defender design.
